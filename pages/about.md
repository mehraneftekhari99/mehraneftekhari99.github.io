Hey there! I'm a senior DevOps engineer and open-source enthusiast with a solid track-record in boosting product speed, reliability, and security. I'm all about using the coolest and latest tech to get top-notch results.

My experience includes some pretty intense uptime-critical work, like with ArvanCloud CDN and Paxful.com. I know my way around Cloud Infra, Docker, Kubernetes, and Linux, and I'm pretty handy at guiding organizations to adopt DevOps practices that really work.

I also head up a team of amazing engineers. We're into everything from Web and Mobile Development to Machine Learning and Network Programming. Since 2016, we've been creating and launching cool stuff in the SaaS world, remote learning, and social media spaces.

I love helping groups hit their goals using tech. Got a project or just want to chat about potential collaborations? Drop me a line at inquiry@shahriar.ee. Let's make something awesome together!
